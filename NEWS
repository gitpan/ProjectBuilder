- Allow usage of mayfailverbose in pb_system when both features are needed to help debuging (Bruno Cornec)

- Really use snapshot for launchve when needed. fix some parts of the condition which were wrong. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix a nasty bug when using an empty value on the right side of the = sign in a conf file, he parameter wasn't created in the cache conf. (Bruno Cornec)
- Changing old checksum for yum from sha1 to sha as it wasn't working at least for RHEL5. (Bruno Cornec)

0.12.1 (2012-05-28)
- Adds pbstoponerr option in conf file to allow to overwrite the default which is back to not stopping on errors as it perturbates VE and VM build for themoment, as not all commands are expected to succeed systematically. (Bruno Cornec)
- Change urpmi.update call from /usr/bin (consolehelper) to /usr/sbin (urpmi) as that's what we have in VE. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix mageia 1 and 2 deps for VE (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds option pbshowsudo (false by default) to check whether we display the detail of sudo commands (to match security requiremetns) or not (to have a nicer output) (Bruno Cornec)
- In VE.pm fix modes of the chroot after the snapshot phase detection to avoid error which make the code die (Bruno Cornec)
- Improve system cmd display in Distribution.pm for deps analysis (Bruno Cornec)
- pb_system is back to 3 params, as the previously undocumented "mayfail" 3rd parameter provides what the 4th was dded for. callers adapted in relationship. Also improves error message displayed (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix another bug in pb_check_req on the default value used with a || where an undef wasn't different from a bad integer. (Bruno Cornec)
- Use pb_cjeck_req for all commands called in the VE for its setup, so it can be used correctly in a secured environement with a sudoers conf file (Cf pbtest) (Bruno Cornec)
- Adds support for the PBVCSOPT env var to pass cli options to the VCS command. Example is authentication method for SVN as in pbtest. (Bruno Cornec)
- Fix pb_syntax, where a call with an exit of 0 was seen as false and thus lead to a value of -1. Now pb -h returns true (Bruno Cornec)

- getconf now loads more conf files, and calls cms_compliant (Bruno Cornec)
- Use new pbgpgcheck option to control whether we enable gpgcheck in the repo script. (Eric Anderson)

- Add next ubuntu codename. (Eric Anderson)

New function will generate 5.m, for all m in [0,n] for version 5.n of some OS. Useful because minor versions are usually similar. Use it in distro_get_param, simplifying the function and making it more powerful. (Eric Anderson)
- add auto-agree-with-licenses for opensuse, other failures on install can occur. (Eric Anderson)
- Fix bug, if we install with yum, put the repo in the yum location.  If we install with zypper, put it in the zypper location. Otherwise complain that we don't know what to do with the file. (Eric Anderson/Bruno Cornec)

- Add in pid to the error output from pb_system for help in tracking down which parent ran the command. (Eric Anderson)

- Document that sshlogin and sshport are now optional parameters. (Eric Anderson)
